# 🔐 Authentication Login System (C++)

The **Smart Login System** is a beginner-to-intermediate C++ project that simulates a real-world login interface.  
It uses conditional logic, loops, and operators (`&&`, `||`) to authenticate users securely with limited login attempts.  

This version also includes an **interactive menu** after successful login, allowing users to:
- 🔎 View account information  
- 🔑 Change passwords dynamically  
- 🚪 Log out securely
